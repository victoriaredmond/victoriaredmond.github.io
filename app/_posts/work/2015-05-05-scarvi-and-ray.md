<strong>YCN 2015 Entry:</strong>
<p>Breif: To promote the Scavi and Ray brand with a fashion related theme.</p>
<p>The bottles feature individual packaging design inspired by prints from London Fashion Week designers. For example, Osman, Nom de Mode and House of Holland. This can be taken further using more designer’s prints.As well as the fashion inspired bottle labels, the packaging also includes a clothing tag showing both the Scavi & Ray logo and the designers logo. This adds a touch of detail, whilst keeping with the fashion theme.</p>
<p>The app designed is available on iPhones and android devices to be used by a wider audience. A key feature of the app is the Scavi & ray locator, which allows fans to locate the nearest places to purchase and experience Scavi & ray prosecco. The app also allows the audience to ‘shop the range’ and purchase Scavi & Ray, the ‘capture the moment’ feature enables fans to upload and share their own images, which can then be shown on the instagram page when using the tag line #proseccoplease.</p>
