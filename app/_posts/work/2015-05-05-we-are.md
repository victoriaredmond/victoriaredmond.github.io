The ‘We Are’ exhibition branding concept derives from the sense of community and diversity of the students at Leeds College of Art. It aims to empower and invigorate the students exhibiting work, as well as inspiring and engaging future students who may be interested in studying at the university. The main focus of the exhibition branding is to capture the eye of professionals and critics and show them.
